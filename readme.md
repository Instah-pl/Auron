# Auron
### Making android project development easier

**Auron allows you to:**
- have a main function
- have some parts of the android api simplified
- have an easy api for permissions

1. Add the auron plugin by using `id("io.instah.Auron-Gradle") version "1.1.0"` *for the newest features append
`-SNAPSHOT` to the version
2. Download the android sdk version `35`

You should be now able to easily configure your project with auron!

\*simplification of the process is planned

*add a way for developers to directly interact with the MainActivity
